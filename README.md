# TalkingPumpkins
Arduino Controlled Talking Pumpkins.

This is an update of my old talking pumpkins project that used an arduino and serial communication with a raspberry pi for audio. 

This project uses a DF-Player mini for the audio playback.

The Library for the DF-player mini can be found at https://github.com/DFRobot/DFPlayer-Mini-mp3

I also created a 3d printed enclosure for this project but it was based on some recovered hardware from an old soundbar.
